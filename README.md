# YOLO Data Labeler

Designed with precision by **Melih Taşkın**, the YOLO Data Labeler is more than a tool—it's a craft echoing the artistry and innovation reminiscent of the grandeur of Ottoman engineering and the vibrant bazaars of Istanbul.

## 🌠 Remarkable Features

- **Effortless Image Selection**: Just as travelers navigate the mesmerizing lanes of Cappadocia, effortlessly guide your way through the dataset with our intuitive interface.
  
- **Instantaneous Label Imports**:

    ```plaintext
    {
       "0": "cat",
       "1": "dog"
    }
    ```

- **Dynamic Image Resizing**: Set your requirements and let the application do its magic, reminiscent of the fluid designs seen in Turkish mosaics.
  
- **Strategic Dataset Segmentation**: Employing the power of scikit-learn's split_train_test, carve out your dataset with precision, ensuring each category is well-represented.

- **Intelligent Design**: Should challenges arise, like when a label has fewer than three instances, our tool promptly alerts you, echoing the foresight of great Turkish strategists.

## 🏰 Sovereignty Over Your Data

- **Offline Operation**: All activities are local—echoing the impenetrable fortresses guarding Anatolia's rich history.
  
- **Absolute Control**: Your data remains untouched and unshared, echoing the principles of integrity deeply rooted in Turkish customs.

- **Transparent Mechanics**: No secret alleys or under-the-table transactions. Your data, your empire.

- **A Truly Independent Tool**: Unlike mainstream platforms that might use your data, with YOLO Data Labeler, you're in the Grand Bazaar, and the choice of trade is entirely yours.
